# Description
This script allows us to mark some songs as checked on a Deezer playlist

Deezer only offers you to select 'All', 'None' or 'manualy' (select each song manually)

This can be cumbersome in some situations, for example when you have a huge list thousands of songs

and you wat to split them into smaller parts

# Usage
<ul>
  <li>1 - Open your Deezer playlist page</li>
  <li>2 - Open Google chrome or your brower developer tools window and go to console</li>
  <li>3 - Copy and paste the following script</li>
  <li>4 - Run it a few times to mark desired songs as checked</li>
  <li>5 - Scroll back to top and select 'add to playlist' and select or create a new playlist</li>
</ul>

 Notice: do not forget to set the startAtId and endAtId to delimit the portion of your playlist you want to markn
         brefore running the script, sheers!!
